# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome using the fork and pull request approach ðŸ™‚ (if you are not familiar with this approach, please visit [_GitHub Docs PRs_](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) for an extended documentation about collaborating with pull request; also, looking at previous merged pull requests helps to get familiar with this).

## Ground Rules

- We use Black code formatting
- We use Pylint
- We document our code

## Contribute to the software

1. Work on your own fork of the main repo
1. In the main repo execute:
    1. **pip install -r dev-requirements.txt** (this installs the [_dev-requirements.txt_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pofff/blob/main/dev-requirements.txt); in addition, both opm Python and LaTeX are required, then for not macOs users run **pip install opm** and **sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra dvipng cm-super**, or else follow the instructions in [_macOS installation_](https://cssr-tools.github.io/pofff/installation.html#source-build-in-macos))
    1. **black src/ tests/** (this formats the code)
    1. **pylint src/ tests/** (this analyses the code, and might rise issues that need to be fixed before the pull request)
    1. **mypy --ignore-missing-imports src/ tests/** (this is a static checker, and might rise issues that need to be fixed before the pull request)
    1. **pytest --cov=pofff --cov-report term-missing tests/** (this runs locally the tests, and might rise issues that need to be fixed before the pull request)
    1. **pushd docs & make html** (this generates the documentation, and might rise issues that need to be fixed before the pull request; if the build succeeds and if the contribution changes the documentation, then delete all content from the [_docs_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pofff/tree/main/docs) folder except [_Makefile_](https://github.com/OPM/pofff/blob/main/docs/Makefile), [_text_](https://github.com/OPM/pofff/blob/main/docs/text), and [_.nojekyll_](https://github.com/OPM/pofff/blob/main/docs/.nojekyll), after copy all contents from the docs/_build/html/ folder, and finally paste them in the [_docs_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pofff/tree/main/docs) folder)
    * Tip: See the [_CI.yml_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pofff/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml) script and the [_Actions_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pofff/actions) for installation of pofff, OPM Flow (binary packages), and dependencies, as well as the execution of the six previous steps in Ubuntu 24.10 using Python3.11.
    * Tip for macOS users: See the [_ci_pycopm_macos_.yml_](https://github.com/daavid00/OPM-Flow_macOS/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci_pycopm_macos.yml) script and the [_OPM-Flow_macOS Actions_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pycopm/actions) for installation of pycopm (another cssr-tool), OPM Flow (source build), and dependencies, as well as running the tests in macOS 26 using Python3.13. Note that to run the pofff tests, you have to add the directory containing the OPM Flow executable to your system's PATH environment variable (e.g., export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/opm-flow); you can check if this worked by after typing in the terminal 'flow \-\-help'.
1. Squash your commits into a single commit (see this [_nice tutorial_](https://gist.github.com/lpranam/4ae996b0a4bc37448dc80356efbca7fa) if you are not familiar with this)
1. Push your commit and make a pull request
1. The maintainers will review the pull request, and if the contribution is accepted, then it will be merged to the main repo 

## Reporting issues or problems

1. Issues or problems can be raised by creating a [_new issue_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pofff/issues) in the repository GitHub page (if you are not familiar with this approach, please visit [_GitHub Docs Issues_](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues)).
1. We will try to answer as soon as possible, but also any user is more than welcome to answer. 

## Seek support

1. The preferred approach to seek support is to raise an issue as described in the previous lines.
1. We will try to answer as soon as possible, but also any user is more than welcome to answer.
- An alternative approach is to send an email to any of the [_mantainers_](https://github.com/cssr-tools/pofff/blob/main/pyproject.toml).
